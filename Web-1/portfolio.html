              to develop a quality IT solution to address organizational needs. These projects typically have both a web and database 
              component requiring students to apply skills acquired in previous semesters. This is accomplished in two phases. 
              The first is Project Planning and Portfolio Development, and includes problem identification, needs assessment, and project planning. 
              The second phase, Project Completion and Portfolio Development, includes design, testing, verification, and customer satisfaction. 
              In addition to the capstone project, students will create a web-based portfolio showcasing skills acquired during the project.</p>
